# Star Wars CLI

This tool allows you to query some of the data from the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/)

See the branch async/await for how to handle this using that pattern.

## How to run

```bash
# Clone this Repo

npm install

# Might need to chmod the sw file

./sw help # see help
./sw --planet # see list of all planets
./sw --planet <planetName> # see planet with all residents
./sw --people # see list of all people
```
